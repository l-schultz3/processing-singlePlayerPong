# singlePlayerPong-Processing
A single player version of pong, created in the processing java language

The reason that I'm not making this a two player game is because of how the processing language processes key presses. Processing cannot get two separate key inputs at the same time, which in a game like pong, ruins the game.
I've made a multiplayer version of pong before, but that was in python using the pygame library.
